---

### PHASE 2: CrewAI Production Guide (COMPLETED ✅)
- ✅ **Created:** `docs/CODE_EXECUTION_STRATEGY.md` (416 lines)
- ✅ **Content:**
  - Decision tree (where/what/when/how code execution)
  - 3 reference implementations:
    - Cloud Sandbox (E2B, Replit)
    - Venv Boundary (SwarmAI pattern)
    - Local Subprocess (cowork-to-code-bridge)
  - Example crew (generator → reviewer → executor)
  - Production checklist (logging, safety, recovery)
  - Resource limits documentation
  - Decision matrix comparing approaches

- ✅ **Commit:** `f5456f0`
- ✅ **Addresses:** CrewAI #6180 feedback from xg-gh-25 (SwarmAI)
- ✅ **Impact:** Positions bridge as canonical reference implementation

---

### PHASE 3: Hermes Integration Enhancements (COMPLETED ✅)

#### 3.1: Quota Tracking (COMPLETED ✅)
- ✅ **Feature:** Quota monitoring in all MCP responses
- ✅ **Implementation:**
  - Reads daily journal from daemon.log
  - Returns: used, remaining, reset_at, limit
  - Default: 100 operations/day
  - Resets: midnight UTC (configurable)
- ✅ **Commit:** `88e6693`
- ✅ **Addresses:** Hermes feedback "How do you track rate limits?"

#### 3.2: Session Cache Mode (COMPLETED ✅)
- ✅ **Feature:** Fresh subprocess context per call
- ✅ **Implementation:**
  - CLI flag: `--session-cache`
  - Routes escalations to subprocess (vs persistent agent)
  - For single-shot debugging workflows
- ✅ **Commit:** `88e6693`
- ✅ **Addresses:** Hermes feedback "Do you have fresh context per call?"

#### 3.3: Async Operation Tools (COMPLETED ✅)
- ✅ **Tool:** `get_operation_status` (idempotent)
  - Check any operation status
  - Returns: status, progress, resume_receipt, quota
  - Safe to call multiple times
- ✅ **Tool:** `cancel_operation` (best-effort)
  - Cancel queued operations (immediate)
  - Graceful shutdown during execution (SIGTERM + timeout)
  - Idempotent: completed operations return no-op
- ✅ **Commit:** `2b2f570`
- ✅ **Addresses:** Async operation semantics needed for long-running workflows

---

### PHASE 4: Polish Enhancements (3-5 hours) — COMPLETED ✅

#### 4.1: Per-Operation Metrics (COMPLETED ✅)
- ✅ **Feature:** Metrics tracking in operation state
- ✅ **Metrics exposed:**
  - tool_calls (count)
  - tool_call_log (history with args/timestamp)
  - api_spend_estimate (cost calculation)
  - memory_mb, cpu_percent (resource tracking)
- ✅ **Integration:** Returned in get_operation_status responses
- ✅ **Commit:** `ffea1f1`
- ✅ **Addresses:** Fame510 feedback (CrewAI #6180)

#### 4.2: Loop Detection (COMPLETED ✅)
- ✅ **Feature:** Automatic repeat-call detection
- ✅ **Logic:** Same tool + args invoked 3+ times triggers alert
- ✅ **Response:** Included in metrics as `repeated_calls` dict
- ✅ **Usage:** Crews use to trigger cancellation
- ✅ **Commit:** `ffea1f1`
- ✅ **Enables:** Automated circuit-breaking for production

#### 4.3: Cancellation Testing (COMPLETED ✅)
- ✅ **Test Suite:** tests/test_cancellation.py (6/6 passing)
- ✅ **Scenarios:**
  - Pre-execution: immediate cancellation (queue deletion)
  - During-execution: SIGTERM signaled, flag set
  - Post-execution: idempotent (no-op)
  - Idempotent retries: safe to retry cancellation
  - Unknown operations: safe no-op
  - Loop detection: correctly identifies repeated calls
- ✅ **Commit:** `103abd1`
- ✅ **Status:** Production-grade semantics validated

#### 4.4: Resume Receipt Enhancement (DOCUMENTATION ADDED)
- ✅ **Updated:** STATEFUL_OPERATION_PATTERN.md
- ✅ **Added:** "Production Safety: Metrics & Loop Detection" section
- ✅ **Content:**
  - Per-operation metrics schema
  - Loop detection explanation
  - Crew integration patterns
  - Agent responsibility (recording metrics)
- ✅ **Commit:** `ffea1f1`

---

### PHASE 5: ClawHub Submission (1-2 hours) — NOT STARTED
- [ ] **Create ClawHub submission**
  - Register as third-party extension
  - Use Dockerfile (ready ✅)
  - Follow ClawHub guidelines

- [ ] **Update integration docs**
  - Add ClawHub link to README
  - Cross-reference from OpenClaw

- [ ] **Post OpenClaw confirmation**
  - Reply to issue #93609
  - Confirm ClawHub submission
